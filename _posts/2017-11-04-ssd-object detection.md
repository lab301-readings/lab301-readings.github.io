# details
**Multi-scale feature maps for detection**

**Convolutional predictors for detection:** 3x3 kernel   default boxes

**Default boxes and aspect ratios:**
scale: ![](https://i.imgur.com/MVbIfLL.png)
aspect ratios: 4 or 6
mxnâ€”>(c+4)kmn

# loss
**Matching strategy:** every ground truth match with IOU higher than a threshold(0.5)

**Loss function:**

L(conf): softmax
L(loc):Â Smooth L1 Loss

# trick
**Negative mining:** ratio between the negatives and positives is at most 3:1

**Data Augmentation:**
For every image: 

>- Use the entire original input image.
>- Sample a patch so that the minimum IOU overlap with the objects is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9.
>- Randomly sample a patch

Then for every patch , horizontally flipped with probability of 0.5
mAP update from 65.4% to 74.3%

# model analysis
>- Data augmentation is crucial
>- More default box shapes is better
>- Atrous is faster
>- Multiple output layers at different resolutions is better

# conclusion
>- The core of SSD :predicting category scores and box offsets for a fixed set of default bounding boxes in multiscale
>- Faster and better
