#Architecture guidelines for stable Deep Convolutional GANs
- Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator)
- Use BN in both the generator and the discriminator
- Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures
- Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh
- Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers
- The use of the Adam optimizer rather than SGD with momentum

# conclusion
>- propose and evaluate a set of constraints on the architectural topology of Convolutional GANs that make them stable to train in most settings
- use the trained discriminators for image classification tasks, showing competitive performance with other unsupervised algorithms
- visualize the filters learnt by GANs and empirically show that specific filters have learned to draw specific objects
- show that the generators have interesting vector arithmetic properties allowing for easy manipulation of many semantic qualities of generated samples
